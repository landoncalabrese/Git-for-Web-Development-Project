## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?


1.) Git is a software for code management.
2.) Github allows you to work with an unlimited amount of people on public projects.
3.) It helps to avoid mixing up different lines of development.
4.) Pull requests allow developers to discuss and review changes made to make sure everything is correct.
5.) git checkout -b *branch*
6.) git pull command  will automatically merge and pull your commit into your local branches, git fetch will update and fetch data from the branches but won't make any changes in your local branch. git merge allows you to take the independent lines of development and make them into a single branch.
7.) A merge conflict is when opposing commits are  unable to be resolved.
8.) There are git commands that could be used such as: get log --merge,  get diff, etc.
